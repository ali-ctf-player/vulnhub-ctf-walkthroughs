# VulnHub CTF Walkthroughs

This repository contains my personal writeups and step-by-step walkthroughs for CTF (Capture The Flag) challenges hosted on [VulnHub](https://www.vulnhub.com/).

Each writeup documents:
- Reconnaissance & enumeration
- Exploitation process
- Privilege escalation steps
- Key commands and tools used
- Lessons learned for future challenges

The goal of this repo is to:
- Share my learning journey in penetration testing
- Provide clear and reproducible methods for solving each machine
- Build a portfolio of hands-on cybersecurity experience

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer:** All targets are intentionally vulnerable machines designed for ethical hacking practice.  
> Do not use any techniques from these writeups on systems you do not own or have permission to test.
